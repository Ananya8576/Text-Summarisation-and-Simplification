# Text-Summarisation-and-Simplification

This project was done for module: CS3244 under Prof. Bryan and Darren and it aims to find the best Machine Learning summarisation model that simplifies content-heavy research papers to a concise, yet informative summary for the reader. 

- Task: To generate simplified summaries of research papers and academic articles
- Target Users: University students
- Resources: Research Papers, Articles, Academic papers
- Proposed Models: RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer
- Metrics Analysed: Bleu and rouge scores, accuracy, brevity, and clarity

Specialising state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Network and Transformer models to the problem by training it with the “Simple English Wikipedia” data set, quantitative assessments were conducted to measure precision and recall, followed by qualitative data collection via surveys, compared to industrial defined summarising and simplification tools.
